#userserver
	The project is to implement a basic RESTful HTTP service in Go for a simplified Tantan backend: Adding users and swiping other people in order to find a match.
#require
	You should follow the API specification given in this document. We want the data to be stored in a PostgreSQL database. All input and output should be in JSON format, and the API should return the proper HTTP status codes.
